This is a README file for an e-commerce website that sells mobile, tablet, earbud and smart watches. The website is created by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,PHP, SQL and Bootstrap. The website has the following features:

- A responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- A dynamic product catalog that displays the available products and their details, such as name, price, description, rating and reviews.
- A shopping cart that allows the user to add, remove and update the products they want to buy.
- A checkout process that validates the user's input and sends the order information to a database using SQL queries.
- A confirmation page that shows the order summary and a thank you message.

The website consists of the following files:

- index.html: The main HTML file that contains the structure and content of the website.
- style.css: The CSS file that defines the style and layout of the website.
- script.js: The JavaScript file that handles the functionality and interactivity of the website.
- products.json: The JSON file that stores the data of the products in an array of objects.
- db.sql: The SQL file that creates and populates the database table for storing the order information.

To run the website locally, you need to have a web server and a database server installed on your computer. You can use XAMPP or WAMP for this purpose. You also need to import the db.sql file into your database server using phpMyAdmin or any other tool. Then, you can open the index.html file in your browser and start browsing the website.
